## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Working through this challenge gave me the opportunity to brush up my basic HTML and CSS skills. Furthermore I got to learn more about flexbox

### Continued development

In future projects I want to deepen my knowledge about flexbox and responsive design. Additionally I am going to learn how to create hover states for all interactive elements.
